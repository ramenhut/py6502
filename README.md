## Python 6502 emulator

A basic unoptimized 6502 emulator in python that was created as part of an offline (aka acapella) engineering challenge over a weekend. See my [NES Emulator](https://bertolami.com/index.php?engine=portfolio&content=software-emulation&detail=nes-emulator) for a much faster and cleaner implementation.

Run `python test.py nestest.nes nestest.log` to test the emulator against the standard nestest rom included in the repo.
